\title{
JMA: Jackknife Model Averaging 
}
\description{
Performs model averaging on a set of (linear) candidate models with the weight vector chosen 
such that the leave-one-out cross validation error is minimized. 
}
\usage{
jma(y,x,ma.method=c("JMA","MMA"),model.subset=c("nested","all"),factor.variables=NULL,pd=T,
                calc.var=c("none","boot"), bsa=100)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
The response vector.
}
  \item{x}{
A matrix or dataframe containing the covariates.
}
  \item{ma.method}{
A character vector specifiying whether jackknife model averaging (JMA) or
Mallow's model averaging (see \code{\link{mma}}) should be performed.
}
  \item{model.subset}{
A character vector specifiying whether all 2^p candidate models should be considered or the nested subset of p models. 
}
  \item{factor.variables}{
A (vector of) string(s) specifying which variables should be treated as factors, i.e. recoded into dummy variables. Factor variables will automatically be recoded if not specified here.
}
  \item{pd}{
A logical value specifying whether messages should be printed or not.
}
\item{calc.var}{A character vector specifying whether no variance should be estimated or based on bootstrapping (\code{"boot"}). 
 }
\item{bsa}{A positive integer specifying the number of bootstrap samples used if \code{variance} \code{=} \code{"boot"}.}
}
\details{
This function utilizes Jackknife model averaging as described in Hansen and Racine (2012), see reference below.

If \code{subset} \code{=} \code{"all"}, then 2^p candidate models are being evaluated. This means p can't be too large (say<20) and 
occasionally the residual matrix used in the quadtratic programming problem may not be positive definite. In the latter case, this matrix
is altered by \code{jma} such that it is positive definite, but results should be interpreted with care.
}
