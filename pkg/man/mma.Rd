\title{
MMA: Mallow's Model Averaging 
}
\description{
Performs model averaging on a set of nested candidate models with the weights vector chosen such that a specific Mallow's criterion is minimized.
}
\usage{
mma(somedata, modelformula = NULL, ycol = 1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{somedata}{
A dataframe or matrix of data.
}
  \item{modelformula}{
Formula of the full model.
}
  \item{ycol}{
Either a character string or integer specifying the column with the outcome variable.
}
}
\details{
Mallow's Model Averaging (MMA) considers all nested submodels of the full model as candidate models, i.e if there are 7 variables there are 7 candidate models. 
The weight vector used to combine the respective estimates is chosen such that a certain Mallow's type criterion is minimized. The final weighted estimate
targets to minimize the mean squared prediciton error and is optimal in some sense, see Theorem 1 and Lemma 3 in Hansen, B. (2007, \emph{Least Squares Model Averaging}, Econometrica, 75:1175-1189).

Note however that the results of MMA depend on the ordering of the regresssors.

\item{averaging.weights}{A matrix containing the weights for each models used in the model averaging procedure.}
